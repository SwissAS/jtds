jTDS Ultra quick start
======================

This software is based on the FreeTDS project that can be found at
http://www.freetds.org/ Much kudos goes to the developers of that
software. More kudos will be included in this file once everything
settles down.

Status
======

pre-alpha

Unstable, breakable not guaranteed to work.

Having said that, I am using it to run corporate systems talking to
a SQL Server 7.0 database.

Supports
========

Everything FreeTDS does except JDBC 1.0 .

Read only scrollable recordsets and cursors.

Requires JDBC 2.0 (JDK 1.3 recommended).

Quick Start
===========

1. Modify conf/properties to point to your server, and put
in your username and password. All the tests use only temporary
tables, so almost any user should do.

2. In a command prompt, type:

build test

This will run a series of tests on your database (see
src/test/freetds/BaseTest.java for an example). Note that some
tests (PerformanceTest) use the odbc driver to compare results,
so if you are running on another OS this test will fail.

TO-DO
=====

1. Update for scrollable recordsets.
2. More metadata.
3. Connection pooling
4. JDBC 3.0 compliance
5. Change package names
