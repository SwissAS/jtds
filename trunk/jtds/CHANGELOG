Changes from jTDS 0.3
=====================

09/06/2002 - Alin Sinpalean

 o Modifications to the EncodingHelper and Tds for a better encoder management
   and changed the default encoding to Cp1252 (when SQL Server responds with
   'iso_1' - that's inexact, SQL Server is, in fact, using Cp1252).
 o Tds.discardResultSet fix: if an error or warning was returned immediately
   after a ResultSet that was not read completely, but discarded, jTDS crashed
   because it only expected TDS_DONE* tokens.

09/05/2002 - Alin Sinpalean

 o Added jdbc3_0-ext.jar to the lib folder, containing the .class files for
   java.sql.Savepoint and java.sql.ParameterMetaData and changed the libraries
   used by JBuilder to include this jar, too. This allows compilation of the
   changes made by Justin under JDK 1.3 and should not affect compilation under
   JDK 1.4.
 o Fixed CursorResultSet.createCursor(): SCROLL_INSENSITIVE cursors could not
   be created because of a syntax error.

09/03/2002 - Justin SB

 o Added stubs to enable compilation with JDK 1.4 (no new functionality)

08/30/2002 - Alin Sinpalean

 o TdsResultSetMetaData.get* fixed (Bug #598911). Still a couple of
   incompatibilities with the JDBC-ODBC bridge, due to the fact that I consider
   their implementation to be incorrect.
 o Synchronized TdsConnection. Still need to do some similar work on Statements
   and ResultSets, but it's a good job, anyway (I hope no deadlocks were
   introduced because of this).
 o Implemented TdsConnection.setCatalog. The dirty way, but it works.

08/28/2002 - Alin Sinpalean

 o Modifications to the javadoc comments in a lot of places (warnings were
   thrown by javasoc).
 o Beautification of TdsDefinitions.
 o TdsConnection.getMetaData() no longer allocates a Tds, because it didn't use
   it anyway. The Tds instance DatabaseMetaData contains is used only for calls
   to methods returning constant values (for that Tds instance).
 o Started fixing Bug #598911 (ResultSetMetaData.get* incorrect):
   Tds.lookupColumnSize() returns the display size rather than the length in
   bytes for fixed size columns, TdsResultSetMetaData.getColumnTypeName()
   returns the SQL Server-specific names of columns, rather than INT1, INT2
   etc.
 o DatabaseMetaData changes: implemented getCrossReference(), changed
   getCatalogs() implementation, removed makeTypeTable() -- no longer used.
 o Changed the implementation of almost all methods in DatabaseMetaData to use
   standard stored procedures instead of the custom but unsafe code. Only a
   couple of methods are still using the old way (getColumns because of custom
   types and getSchemas because the result would be the second column and it's
   currently impossible to hide any columns but the last ones).

08/26/2002 - Alin Sinpalean

 o Database name is no longer explicitly required in the URL for the driver or
   to be set for the DataSource. The default value for it (if not specified) is
   "master", which is ok for SQL Server, but of which I'm not so sure of for
   Sybase (Bug #598886).
 o Changed the implementation of DatabaseMetaData methods getProcedures,
   getProcedureColumns and ... to use SQL Server-defined stored procedures, for
   increased performance and better compatibility with other drivers.

08/23/2002 - Alin Sinpalean

 o Improved NULL, 0-length and single-space string handling (both when sending
   parameters and receiving values.
 o Tds.rollback() just drops all procedures submitted during the last
   transaction rather than resubmitting them (no one can guarantee they will be
   used again, so better just drop them).
 o Removed TdsComm.backup() - wasn't used anymore and was pretty dangerous
   anyway.
 o Changes to AsTest and CSUnitTest to reflect the way update counts are
   returned from PreparedStatements and CallableStatements.
 o Added a freetds.SAfeTest test to test the NULL, 0-length and single-space
   string handling.

08/21/2002 - Alin Sinpalean

 o jTDS officially became "jTDS Type 4 JDBC 2.0 driver for MS SQL Server", as
   DatabaseMetaData.getDriverName() returns this value.
 o Not directly related to the development of jTDS, The jTDS Project finally
   has its own homepage: http://jtds.sourceforge.net

08/20/2002 - Alin Sinpalean

 o Added a Statement member to the Tds class, that should point to the
   Statement currently using the object (if any, null if not used). Using this
   the Tds can decide whether to return update counts from DONEINPROC packets
   if the current Statement is a PreparedStatement. This way, PreparedStatement
   can return update counts from inside stored procedures while Statement
   doesn't.
 o Fixed the tests that failed because of the fact that more Statements were
   allocated at once (meaning some of them were not able to create the
   temporary tables/stored procedures created by others) by closing the
   Statements when they were no longer needed.
 o Implemented all methods of ResultSetMetaData except getColumnClassName and
   used case sensitivity and table name from result packets (both TDS 4.2 and
   TDS 7.0). (Request #587751)
 o Fixed TdsStatement.rollback(): calls Tds.rollback() when not in autocommit
   mode, in order to redefine all missing stored procedures.


===============================================================================
08/19/2002 - jTDS 0.3 released
===============================================================================

Changes from jTDS 0.2
=====================

08/19/2002 - Alin Sinpalean

 o Check for ENVCHANGE packets in TdsStatement.getMoreResultsImpl (if a query
   that changed the environment was executed, the driver crashed because of
   unrecognized packet types - ENVCHANGE).
 o Added a fakeColumnCount to Columns to mask columns to the end user (e.g. for
   meta data use).
 o Implemented methods in DatabaseMetaData: getColumnPrivileges,
   getTablePrivileges, getTypeInfo, getBestRowIdentifier, getVersionColumns.
   Also some minor changes to methods returning constant values.
 o Bugfix (#595022): Hidden the rowstat column returned by CursorResultSets.

08/16/2002 - Alin Sinpalean

 o DatabaseMetaData.getSchemas() fix: TABLE_CATALOG column was also returned as
   a result column; removed it.
 o TdsResultSet.fetchNextRow() fix: the Tds was not released when the end of
   data was reached; now it is.
 o TdsConnection.prepareCall() fix: a useless call to allocateTds() was made,
   which locked a Tds that was never released again; commented out.
 o Fixes in the tests: AsTest, CSUnitTest, PreparedStatementTest, TestBase,
   TimestampTest.
 o Condition in Microsoft7MetaData.getProcedures() to avoid
   NullPointerExceptions when a null schema pattern was provided.

08/15/2002 - Alin Sinpalean

 o Rewrote build.xml.

08/14/2002 - Alin Sinpalean

 o Added support for the UNIQUEIDENTIFIER datatype.
 o Created a com.internetcds.jdbcx.tds package containing a DataSource
   implementation and an object factory (alpha version, not even tested with
   JNDI - I tried to do it but it doesn't seem that easy). Anyway, it's a
   starting point.

08/13/2002 - Alin Sinpalean

 o Fix in CursorResultSet: if no rows were returned by the query, loadContext
   failed with a NullPointerException when trying to get the current row's
   context. Now the context is loaded in internalFetch -- not very elegant, but
   at least it works. ;o)

08/08/2002 - Alin Sinpalean

 o DatabaseMetaData.getInstance() now returns a DatabaseMetaData or
   Microsoft7MetaData based on the TDS version rather than the server version.

08/06/2002 - Alin Sinpalean

 o Optimized the implementations of TdsComm.getBytes(int) and TdsComm.peek();
   they are no longer using TdsComm.getByte(), which was slowing them down.
 o Implemented getExportedKeys.
 o TDS 7.0 is now the default protocol used by jTDS.

08/05/2002 - Alin Sinpalean

 o Added a databaseMajorVersion member to the Tds class to help make the
   difference between SQL Server versions (e.g. for DatabaseMetaData usage).
 o Fixed some of the additions Jason made, most of them due to the fact that
   he probably used SQLServer 2000 while I am using 7.0 (there could be some
   even bigger problems for people using SQLServer 6.5, if there are any) and
   a problem related to getTables - catalog name for tables in other databases
   (catalogs) were wrong (pubs was used instead of the catalog name).
 o Added implementations to methods without parameters returning boolean values
   in DatabaseMetaData (based on values returned by the JDBC-ODBC and some
   other drivers).
 o Bugfix 587749: Bit to Int conversion works. So does Binary to String.

08/05/2002 - Jason Banes (patch)

 o Fixed the following methods in DatabaseMetaData: getSchemas, getTables,
   getColumns, supportSchemasInTableDefinitions.
 o Implemented the following methods of DatabaseMetaData: getIndexes,
   getPrimaryKeys, getImportedKeys.

07/xx/2002
 o TdsStatement checks if it isn't already closed on a call to close() and the
   allocated Tds object isn't freed until no more results are available
