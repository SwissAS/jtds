Changes from jTDS 0.3
=====================

08/20/2002 - Alin Sinpalean

 o Added a Statement member to the Tds class, that should point to the
   Statement currently using the object (if any, null if not used). Using this
   the Tds can decide whether to return update counts from DONEINPROC packets
   if the current Statement is a PreparedStatement. This way, PreparedStatement
   can return update counts from inside stored procedures while Statement
   doesn't.
 o Fixed the tests that failed because of the fact that more Statements were
   allocated at once (meaning some of them were not able to create the
   temporary tables/stored procedures created by others) by closing the
   Statements when they were no longer needed.


Changes from jTDS 0.2
=====================

08/19/2002 - jTDS 0.3 released

08/19/2002 - Alin Sinpalean

 o Check for ENVCHANGE packets in TdsStatement.getMoreResultsImpl (if a query
   that changed the environment was executed, the driver crashed because of
   unrecognized packet types - ENVCHANGE).
 o Added a fakeColumnCount to Columns to mask columns to the end user (e.g. for
   meta data use).
 o Implemented methods in DatabaseMetaData: getColumnPrivileges,
   getTablePrivileges, getTypeInfo, getBestRowIdentifier, getVersionColumns.
   Also some minor changes to methods returning constant values.
 o Bugfix (#595022): Hidden the rowstat column returned by CursorResultSets.

08/16/2002 - Alin Sinpalean

 o DatabaseMetaData.getSchemas() fix: TABLE_CATALOG column was also returned as
   a result column; removed it.
 o TdsResultSet.fetchNextRow() fix: the Tds was not released when the end of
   data was reached; now it is.
 o TdsConnection.prepareCall() fix: a useless call to allocateTds() was made,
   which locked a Tds that was never released again; commented out.
 o Fixes in the tests: AsTest, CSUnitTest, PreparedStatementTest, TestBase,
   TimestampTest.
 o Condition in Microsoft7MetaData.getProcedures() to avoid
   NullPointerExceptions when a null schema pattern was provided.

08/15/2002 - Alin Sinpalean

 o Rewrote build.xml.

08/14/2002 - Alin Sinpalean

 o Added support for the UNIQUEIDENTIFIER datatype.
 o Created a com.internetcds.jdbcx.tds package containing a DataSource
   implementation and an object factory (alpha version, not even tested with
   JNDI - I tried to do it but it doesn't seem that easy). Anyway, it's a
   starting point.

08/13/2002 - Alin Sinpalean

 o Fix in CursorResultSet: if no rows were returned by the query, loadContext
   failed with a NullPointerException when trying to get the current row's
   context. Now the context is loaded in internalFetch -- not very elegant, but
   at least it works. ;o)

08/08/2002 - Alin Sinpalean

 o DatabaseMetaData.getInstance() now returns a DatabaseMetaData or
   Microsoft7MetaData based on the TDS version rather than the server version.

08/06/2002 - Alin Sinpalean

 o Optimized the implementations of TdsComm.getBytes(int) and TdsComm.peek();
   they are no longer using TdsComm.getByte(), which was slowing them down.
 o Implemented getExportedKeys.
 o TDS 7.0 is now the default protocol used by jTDS.

08/05/2002 - Alin Sinpalean

 o Added a databaseMajorVersion member to the Tds class to help make the
   difference between SQL Server versions (e.g. for DatabaseMetaData usage).
 o Fixed some of the additions Jason made, most of them due to the fact that
   he probably used SQLServer 2000 while I am using 7.0 (there could be some
   even bigger problems for people using SQLServer 6.5, if there are any) and
   a problem related to getTables - catalog name for tables in other databases
   (catalogs) were wrong (pubs was used instead of the catalog name).
 o Added implementations to methods without parameters returning boolean values
   in DatabaseMetaData (based on values returned by the JDBC-ODBC and some
   other drivers).
 o Bugfix 587749: Bit to Int conversion works. So does Binary to String.

08/05/2002 - Jason Banes (patch)

 o Fixed the following methods in DatabaseMetaData: getSchemas, getTables,
   getColumns, supportSchemasInTableDefinitions.
 o Implemented the following methods of DatabaseMetaData: getIndexes,
   getPrimaryKeys, getImportedKeys.

07/xx/2002
 o TdsStatement checks if it isn't already closed on a call to close() and the
   allocated Tds object isn't freed until no more results are available
