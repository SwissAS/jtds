Changes from jTDS 0.2
=====================

08/16/2002 - Alin Sinpalean

 o DatabaseMetaData.getSchemas() fix: TABLE_CATALOG column was also returned as
   a result column; removed it.
 o TdsResultSet.fetchNextRow() fix: the Tds was not released when the end of
   data was reached; now it is.
 o TdsConnection.prepareCall() fix: a useless call to allocateTds() was made,
   which locked a Tds that was never released again; commented out.
 o Fixes in the tests: AsTest, CSUnitTest, PreparedStatementTest, TestBase,
   TimestampTest.

08/15/2002 - Alin Sinpalean

 o Rewrote build.xml.

08/14/2002 - Alin Sinpalean

 o Added support for the UNIQUEIDENTIFIER datatype.
 o Created a com.internetcds.jdbcx.tds package containing a DataSource
   implementation and an object factory (alpha version, not even tested with
   JNDI - I tried to do it but it doesn't seem that easy). Anyway, it's a
   starting point.

08/13/2002 - Alin Sinpalean

 o Fix in CursorResultSet: if no rows were returned by the query, loadContext
   failed with a NullPointerException when trying to get the current row's
   context. Now the context is loaded in internalFetch -- not very elegant, but
   at least it works. ;o)

08/08/2002 - Alin Sinpalean

 o DatabaseMetaData.getInstance() now returns a DatabaseMetaData or
   Microsoft7MetaData based on the TDS version rather than the server version.

08/06/2002 - Alin Sinpalean

 o Optimized the implementations of TdsComm.getBytes(int) and TdsComm.peek();
   they are no longer using TdsComm.getByte(), which was slowing them down.
 o Implemented getExportedKeys.
 o TDS 7.0 is now the default protocol used by jTDS.

08/05/2002 - Alin Sinpalean

 o Added a databaseMajorVersion member to the Tds class to help make the
   difference between SQL Server versions (e.g. for DatabaseMetaData usage).
 o Fixed some of the additions Jason made, most of them due to the fact that
   he probably used SQLServer 2000 while I am using 7.0 (there could be some
   even bigger problems for people using SQLServer 6.5, if there are any) and
   a problem related to getTables - catalog name for tables in other databases
   (catalogs) were wrong (pubs was used instead of the catalog name).
 o Added implementations to methods without parameters returning boolean values
   in DatabaseMetaData (based on values returned by the JDBC-ODBC and some
   other drivers).
 o Bugfix 587749: Bit to Int conversion works. So does Binary to String.

08/05/2002 - Jason Banes (patch)

 o Fixed the following methods in DatabaseMetaData: getSchemas, getTables,
   getColumns, supportSchemasInTableDefinitions.
 o Implemented the following methods of DatabaseMetaData: getIndexes,
   getPrimaryKeys, getImportedKeys.

07/xx/2002
 o TdsStatement checks if it isn't already closed on a call to close() and the
   allocated Tds object isn't freed until no more results are available
