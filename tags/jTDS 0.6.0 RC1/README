jTDS Ultra quick start
======================

This software is based on the FreeTDS project that can be found at
http://www.freetds.org/. Much kudos goes to the developers of that software.

Lots of thanks go to SourceForge.net, who in a big part made possible the very
existence of jTDS.

Status
======

Alpha (Beta is really, really close)

Stable for concurrent usage for forward-only result sets. Not that safe for
multiple scrollable result sets. ;o)

An untested DataSource implementation is also provided.

Meta data information is 99.99% complete (both ResultSetMetaData and
DatabaseMetaData).

I am personally using jTDS in high-end web apps and I have also personally
tested with SQuirreL SQL Client (http://squirrel-sql.sourceforge.net/),
Db-Visualizer (http://www.minq.se/products/dbvis/index.html) and SQL Developer
(http://sqldeveloper.solyp.com/, really nice tool).

DataDino (http://www.datadino.com/) comes bundled with jTDS as its interface
for Microsoft SQL Server.

For more information about jTDS check out the project's home
(http://jtds.sourceforge.net). It has just been updated with a lot of new
information.

Supports
========

Read only scrollable recordsets and cursors. Multiple (parallel) statements per
connection.

Works on both JDK 1.3 and 1.4 (although it's a JDBC 2.0 driver it implements
stubs for JDBC 3.0, which currently only throw exceptions :o) ).

Quick Start
===========

1. Modify conf/properties to point to your server, and put in your username and
password. All the tests (except PerformanceTest, which will probably fail for
you anyway :o( ) use only temporary tables, so almost any user should do.

2. In a command prompt, type:

build test

This will run a series of JUnit tests on your database. Note that some tests
(PerformanceTest) use the odbc driver to compare results, so if you are running
on another OS this test will fail.

URL Format
==========

The URL format for jTDS is:

jdbc:jtds:sqlserver://<hostname>[:<port][/<dbname>][;<property>=<value>[;...]]

For Sybase (although, as far as I know jTDS was never tested with Sybase)
replace 'sqlserver' with 'sybase'.

As for the properties, you can specify them in the URL, as shown above or
by using DriverManager.getConnection(String URL, Properties props). The
most important properties (the ones I use) are 'user', 'password',
'charset' and 'TDS'. The last one specifies the TDS version to be used:
by default TDS 7.0 is used (the TDS 4.2 implementation has some limitations,
e.g. VARCHARs are limited to 255 chars). So, if you want to use SQL Server 4.2
 you will have to specify 'TDS'='4.2' (either way -- URL or Properties).

To Do
=====

1. Update and sync for scrollable recordsets.
2. CallableStatement full support ("{?=call ...}" does not currently work)
3. Connection pooling
4. JDBC 3.0 compliance
