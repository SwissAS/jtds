jTDS Ultra quick start
======================

This software is based on the FreeTDS project that can be found at
http://www.freetds.org/ Much kudos goes to the developers of that
software. More kudos will be included in this file once everything
settles down.

Status
======

Alpha

Pretty stable for basic usage. Unstable, breakable if used concurrently.

Having said that, I am using it in commercial products based on the Java
servlet technology (quite serious stuff).

Supports
========

Read only scrollable recordsets and cursors. Multiple (parallel)
statements per connection.

Requires JDBC 2.0 (JDK 1.3 recommended). Maybe JDBC 3.0 will be
available sometimes in the future.

Quick Start
===========

1. Modify conf/properties to point to your server, and put
in your username and password. All the tests use only temporary
tables, so almost any user should do.

2. In a command prompt, type:

build test

This will run a series of tests on your database (see
src/test/freetds/BaseTest.java for an example). Note that some
tests (PerformanceTest) use the odbc driver to compare results,
so if you are running on another OS this test will fail.

Also, please note that some of the tests use tables that you very
probably don't have. I will try to fix this.

URL Format
==========

The URL format for jTDS is:

jdbc:freetds:sqlserver://<hostname>[:<port]/<dbname>[;<property>=<value>[;...]] 

For Sybase (although, as far as I know jTDS was never tested with Sybase)
replace 'sqlserver' with 'sybase'. 

As for the properties, you can specify them in the URL, as shown above or
by using DriverManager.getConnection(String URL, Properties props). The
most important properties (the ones I use) are 'user', 'password',
'charset' and 'TDS'. The last one specifies the TDS version to be used:
by default TDS 4.2 is used although the TDS 7.0 implementation works fine
and 4.2 has some limitations (e.g. VARCHARs are limited to 255 chars).
Maybe this will change in the future. So, if you want to use SQL Server
7.0's features, you will have to specify 'TDS'='7.0' (either way -- URL
or Properties).

TO-DO
=====

1. Update for scrollable recordsets.
2. More metadata.
3. Connection pooling
4. JDBC 3.0 compliance
5. Change package names
